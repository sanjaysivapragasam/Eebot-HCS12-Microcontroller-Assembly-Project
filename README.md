# Eebot-HCS12-Microcontroller-Assembly-Project

This was a final project for my intro to Microcontrollers and Assembly Programming course. Using an Eebot and the HCS12 Microcontroller, my team and I were able to program the bot to complete a maze. This was accomplished by utilizing the sensors and bumpers on the bot to ensure the maze race line was correctly followed.
